I am Abdellah Alaoui Solaimani. I am professional software developer.
I write JavaScript code day to day. Technologies i use and enjoy are React, node.js and react-native.
I only work remotely, but i'm interested in conducting on-site trainings. So ping me if you're interested.
You can find some of my code at Github:
